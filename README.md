> *Sprite is from Terraria*  

**Tracer** is an addon for godot 4 for structured, customizable traces, heavily inspired by [tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing).

## ‚ú® Features
* Multiple log levels and filtering
* Colored output
* Useful information such as the script a span is located in, the current thread id and timestamps
* Modular design
* [Support for custom writers](https://github.com/wyvernbw/tracer.gd/wiki/Saving-logs-to-a-file)

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How it works
The `Tracer` autoload stores traces that are then consumed by subscribers. This addond includes a default subscriber in the form of `TraceSubscriber`. Users are free to implement their own subscribers. Multiple subscribers can run in parallel to log spans with different settings. 
### Getting Started
You can find this example in [examples/test](https://github.com/wyvernbw/tracer.gd/tree/main/examples/test)

During initialization of your game (the ready function for example), start by building a subscriber
```gdscript
	# Build a subscriber with all the bells and whistles
	var subscriber = (
		TraceSubscriber
		. new()
		. with_nicer_colors(false)
	) # default options omitted for simplicity
```
After which, simply initialize the subscriber by calling it's `init` method
```gdscript
	subscriber.init()
```
And that's it. This will add the subscriber as a child to the `Tracer` autoload and will hook it up to consume the traces. Now you can use the provided functions to create these traces.
```gdscript
	Tracer.info("Game Started!")
	Tracer.debug("Initializing systems... üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è")
	Tracer.warn("Cannot find file 'data.json' ü§î")
	Tracer.error("Cannot communicate with server üò±")
```
This will result in this output:
```
[2023-11-02T12:02:36] INFO examples/test/test.gd::_ready: Game Started!
[2023-11-02T12:02:36] DEBUG examples/test/test.gd::_ready: Initializing systems...

```
